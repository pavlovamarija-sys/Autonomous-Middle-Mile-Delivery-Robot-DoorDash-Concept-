# Autonomous Middle-Mile Delivery Robot (DoorDash Concept)

**Product Management Case Study – Udacity Product Manager Nanodegree**

This project explores the opportunity for DoorDash to optimize **middle-mile delivery operations** using an **autonomous delivery robot**. It follows the full product lifecycle—from opportunity discovery to design, validation, and go-to-market strategy—demonstrating how a Product Manager brings a concept from idea to launch.

## Project Overview

Middle-mile delivery remains a significant cost driver and operational bottleneck for food platforms like DoorDash. This case study proposes a robotics-based solution to improve delivery efficiency, reduce variability, and scale operations sustainably.

The project examines:

* Market and competitive analysis
* User and stakeholder interviews
* Problem definition and opportunity sizing
* Rapid prototyping and design sprint process
* Engineering and operational considerations
* Product roadmap, KPIs, and success metrics
* Go-to-market and launch strategy

---

## Objectives

* Identify a high-impact opportunity in delivery logistics
* Validate user needs across merchants, dashers, and customers
* Design an end-to-end autonomous robot experience
* Develop a product strategy that balances feasibility, desirability, and viability
* Build a launch-ready proposal with KPIs, risks, and mitigation plans

---

## Research & Insights

* **Market analysis** revealed fast-growing demand for autonomous delivery, driven by rising delivery volumes and efficiency pressures.
* **User interviews** uncovered frustration with delivery delays, inconsistent timing, and operational inefficiencies in the middle-mile segment.
* **Competitive analysis** highlighted emerging robotics players but also gaps in mid-distance delivery automation.

Key Insight:

> Middle-mile automation offers significant potential for reliability improvements without disrupting the customer-facing delivery experience.

---

## Design Sprint Summary

The concept was validated through a full 5-day design sprint:

1. **Understand** — Identify root problems and map the customer journey
2. **Diverge** — Explore multiple solution paths
3. **Decide** — Select the most promising robot-assisted workflow
4. **Prototype** — Build an interactive interface and operational flow
5. **Test** — Collect feedback from users and refine the concept

---

## User Feedback

Testing revealed users valued:

* Predictable delivery times
* Reduced food-handling steps
* Seamless communication between merchant → robot → dasher

Feedback informed improvements to:

* The robot’s pickup and drop-off workflow
* Safety and reliability expectations
* Notification and coordination systems

---

## Product Specification

The final Product Requirements Document (PRD) includes:

* Problem statement
* Defined personas and use cases
* Feature set and prioritization
* Engineering assumptions and constraints
* Operational workflows
* KPIs and telemetry requirements
* Risk mitigation strategy

---

## Roadmap

The roadmap is structured in three phases:

1. **Pilot MVP** – Basic autonomous navigation + controlled route testing
2. **Operational Beta** – Integration with merchant and dasher workflows
3. **Full Launch** – Scaled deployment with performance automation

---

## KPIs & Success Metrics

* Middle-mile delivery time variance ↓
* Per-order operational costs ↓
* On-time delivery rate ↑
* Merchant satisfaction ↑
* System reliability + uptime metrics ↑

---

## Go-To-Market Strategy

The GTM plan includes:

* Pilot city selection
* Required partnerships (cities, robotics infrastructure, merchants)
* Sales enablement and CS training
* Internal operational readiness
* Launch risk analysis and mitigation plans

---

## Technologies & Tools

While the project is concept-level and product-focused, work was supported by:

* Figma (prototyping & design sprint)
* Miro (storyboards, workflows)
* Google Workspace (user research, PRD, roadmap)
* Udacity PM frameworks & templates

---

## 📄 Deliverables

* Market research & opportunity analysis
* Design sprint results (storyboards, prototype, insights)
* Product Requirements Document (PRD)
* KPI framework
* Launch strategy & risk assessment
* Final presentation deck
